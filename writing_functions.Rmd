# load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

# write my first function!

as an example, here's a z-score computation

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(n = 25, mean = 10, sd = 3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

now i'll write a function to do this

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("x needs to be numeric")
  }
  
  if (length(x) < 5) {
    stop("you need at least five numbers to compute z score")
  }
  
  z = (x-mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
  }

z_scores(x = x_vec)
```

does this always work?

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(x = 3)
z_scores(x = c("my", "name", "is", "mia"))
```
